# 🎯 Object Detection and Tracking using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to detect and track moving objects in a video using OpenCV. The goal is to identify vehicles on a highway and track their movement across frames.Detects vehicles in a video using background subtraction, filters noise, defines ROI, and tracks each vehicle with unique IDs in real time. Ideal for beginners exploring computer vision and surveillance applications.
